### 👋 Hello, I'm Soransh Singh!

I'm a passionate **React Native / Frontend Developer** who fell in love with programming through C++ back in school, and I've never looked back. My journey has taken me through the worlds of JavaScript, Python, Java, Lua (hello, 2D games!), and more—each new language and framework adds a spark to my curiosity.

I thrive on learning, building, and mastering new skills, always hungry for the next technology or creative project. Outside of code, you'll find me lost in novels—Murakami, Kundera, Stephen King, and George Orwell are some of my literary heroes. Got book recommendations or want to nerd out about authors? Let's chat!
